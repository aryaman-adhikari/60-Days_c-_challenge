# ðŸš€ðŸš€60-Days_c-_challenge
In this challenge i am going to learn about c++ till 60 days or more . In this challenge i will start from basic concept to advance topics. 


## âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡Topics to be covered in this challenges are::
- What is OOP? Understanding the fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming and its significance in modern software development.
- Structure of CPP Programs: Grasping the layout and organization of C++ programs to build robust and scalable applications.
- Data types, variables, keywords, and identifiers: Laying the foundation with essential building blocks of C++.
- Operators and control structures: Gaining control over the flow of programs with decision-making and loop constructs.
- Functions and inline functions: Learning to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units for efficient coding.
- Function overloading: Exploring the powerful technique of writing multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- Classes, Objects, Constructor, and Destructor: Unraveling the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, a paradigm widely used in real-world applications.
- Types of Constructors: Mastering the various forms of constructors to initialize objects effectively.
- Inheritance and Polymorphism: Understanding the relationships between classes and leveraging the ability to write flexible and reusable code.
- Friend function and Friend class: Exploring unique relationships between functions and classes that transcend encapsulation boundaries.
- Pointer and Virtual Function: Getting hands-on with memory management and dynamic polymorphism.
- Virtual Classes: Delving deeper into the concepts of virtual classes for creating hierarchies of classes.
- File management: Learning to read from and write to files, is a crucial aspect of data handling in applications.
- Exception handling: Gaining the skills to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully and ensuring robustness.
- Templates and STL: Unleashing the power of generic programming and understanding the Standard Template Library for efficient coding.
