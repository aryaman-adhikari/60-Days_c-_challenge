In day 2 i learned about the basic features of c++ language and the differences between c and c++. Also the history of c++ and it's evolution.
Let's begin with it's evolution.
⚡⚡It was developed by Bjarne stroustrup at Bell lab(At&T). He was working in the project with simula 67 (the first oop language developed by ole-ohan Dahl &kristen Nygaard at olso in 1960s.)
⚡⚡Stroustrup needed a language which is compatible with objects and classes also containing the function of C langauge. So, in 1979AD he developed a language and named it C with classes .Later in the1983AD it was renamed as c++.
⚡⚡First version of proper c++ was developed in 1998 and named as c++98. Later c++03(2003AD),c++05(2005AD),c++11(2011AD),c++14(2014AD),c++17(2017AD).
⚡⚡Note:: c++x version cannot be installed because of various technical problems and c++23(2023AD) is going to be launched soon in future.
  
NOW,Let's look over the features of c++ language:
1.It follows the concept of OOPs.
2.Multi-paradigm(POPs &OOPs)
3.Not purely OOP(friend function declined the concept of OOPs)
4.General purpose programming language
5.Mid level programming Language
6.High level applications like Desktop applications ,games, translators as well as database languages like oracle, SQLetc are developed by c++.
7.It is complied language.
8.It is portable but not machine independent.
9.It is extensible.
10.Case sensitive language.
11.Pointer concept .
12.Strongly typed programming language. 

Now, let's move towards the simple program of c++ to the programs that uses the objects from io stream .
