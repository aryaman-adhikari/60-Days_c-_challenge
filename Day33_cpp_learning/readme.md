# Abstraction
> Data abstraction in C++ is one of the fundamental concept of object oriented programming that allows us to hide the complex implementation details of a class while exposing the simplified interface to interact with that class . It focuses on seperating the internal implementation and public interface of class.
- It can be achieved by two ways:
1. Abstract Class
2. Interface

# Abstract Class
> As we all know that if a class contains pure virtual function then that class is said to be Abstract class.
