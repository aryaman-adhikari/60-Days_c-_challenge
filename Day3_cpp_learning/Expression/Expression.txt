#So, basically expression in c++ is the combinations of equations , operands, values ,function calls etc that is processed in order to give result is expressions. There are various types of expression in c++
1.Constant Expression
-->A constant expression in C++ is an expression that can be evaluated by the compiler at compile-time and results in a constant value. In other words, a constant expression is an expression whose value is known and fixed at compile-time, and it does not depend on run-time variables or computations.
-->for example in a program if we assign a value in a arg variable like :
arg=25;  and if x=20+5/10 then these are known as constant expression where value is not given in execution time .It is already given in the time of writting code.

2.Integral Expression
-->The expression which gives result in integer is integral expression. for example: m=5 then  ex: m= m*5 etc.

3.Float Expression
-->The expression that gives result in floating point is float expression. for example: if x=1.0,y=2.0 then z=x+y gives result in floating point.

4.Pointer Expression
-->The expression that gives result in the form of address of any thing is pointer expression. Ex: m=5 then x=&m gives the address of m in x.

5.Relational Expression 
-->The expression that gives result in the boolean form (i.e either true or false) is relational expression.
for ex: x=5,y=10
if(x<=y) Then it gives true
if(x>y)   then it gives false

6.logical Expression
-->Combination of two or more relational expression is logical expresssion.It
 also gives result in boolean form.
for example:
a=5,b=1,x=10
then, 
(a>b && x==10)
gives us true result


7.Bit wise expression
-->Manipulate the data in bit level. Testing of data or shifting of bits .
for example:
x=1000.55
then 
x<<3 
then it gives x=1.00055
